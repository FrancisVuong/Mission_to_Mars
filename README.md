# Written Report for the Mission_to_Mars

## Overview of Mission_to_Mars  Challenge 

- In this challenge we are working with Robin to create a web app to scrap images and data of Mars.

### Purpose

- We are scraping images of the 4 hemispheres of Mars as well as some basic planet information to present onto our web app.  

## Analysis and Challenges

- Through this challenge we used our tools of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full resolution images, we used MongoDB to store the data and displayed our findings on google Chrome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes 

- We were successful in our scrapping and have gathered images of the 4 different hemispheres of Mars. Presenting the data on our web app(index), with titles. 
- We also added some Bootstrap 3 componenets to the web app to customize the presentation slightly.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main challenge I had was the new language. HTML is a little bit different then python so it was a bit of a struggle grasping and utilizing the different language but I was able to work through it eventually. 

## Results
- The web app that was created was functional to the point of the challenge however I did not have enough time to go into much more depth than that throughout the week.
- In the future if/ when I have more time I would like to develop a better web app that looks much better and is more functional than what I presented in this challenge.
